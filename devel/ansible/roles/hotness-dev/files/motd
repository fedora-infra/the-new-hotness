Welcome to The New Hotness development environment!

To start development you need to do this first:

* add your bugzilla credentials or API key to ~/.fedmsg.d/hotness.py

* acquire a valid Kerberos ticket by `kinit <fas-username>@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG`

Here are some tips:

* The code for the-new-hotness is located at ~/devel/

* Run `hotstart` to start the development services and `hotstop` to stop it.

* Logs for the server are available with `journalctl` or `hotlog`; the services are run
  as systemd user units in ~/.config/systemd/user/

* Run tests with `tox`

* To build documentation run `tox -e docs`

* For additional informations see documentation
  <https://the-new-hotness.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

Happy hacking!
