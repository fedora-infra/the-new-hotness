0.8.1
-----

0.8.1 is a bugfix release intended to improve the reliability of
the-new-hotness, particularly the code responsible for creating Koji scratch
builds for new updates.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

 - Attempting to remove a working directory that's already gone no longer
   results in a traceback (#154)

 - Fetching package sources now has greatly improved error reporting (#161)

 - Packages with multiple source tarballs are now correctly handled.
   Previously, only the first source URL was used (#161)


0.8.0
-----

- rebase-helper has been removed from the-new-hotness. For a detailed
  discussion that lead to this decision, see issue #145.

- the-new-hotness now integrates with mdapi to determine the latest available
  versions of packages rather than repoquery. This fixes a bug where
  the-new-hotness would report that the latest rawhide build was the build in
  EPEL 7 (Issue #98)

- The ``userstring`` setting has been replaced by a ``user_email`` setting.
  This setting is tuple in the form ('User Name', '<email address>').

- Several configuration URLs have been updated to use HTTPS

- Log entries are now emitted with their full Python path included so debugging
  is easier.

- the-new-hotness now authenticates with Koji using Kerberos
