To start development you need to do this first:

* add your bugzilla credentials or API key to ~/config.toml

* acquire a valid Kerberos ticket by `kinit <fas-username>@FEDORAPROJECT.ORG`

Here are some tips:

* Run tests with `tox`

* To build documentation run `tox -e docs`

* For additional informations see documentation
